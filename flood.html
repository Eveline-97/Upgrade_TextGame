                <span class="text-line">Seeing sound-waves were more frequent and more distinct</span>
                <span class="text-line">than they had been since the time of the Flood</span>
                <span class="text-line">They were thought to be the first signs of an impending flood</span>
                <span class="text-line">which will change the land's layout forever</span>
                <span class="text-line">to the confusion caused by the Flood</span>

                <span class="text-line">The waves had come from far and wide-spread</span>
                <span class="text-line">and took the shape of the Flood</span>
                <span class="text-line">The sea in which people had found shelter was a huge whirlpool like a sea
                    floor</span>
                <span class="text-line">and people were covered in white, thin pieces of concrete like concrete
                    bricks</span>
                <span class="text-line">The Flood was much more numerous than this</span>
                <span class="text-line">and more than the Earth did during the time of the Flood</span>

                <span class="text-line">It could only be stopped by creating the right shape</span>
