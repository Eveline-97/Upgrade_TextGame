    <div id="container">
        <div id="game">
            <p id="text">
                <span class="text-line">A violin is an instrument of music</span>
                <span class="text-line">An instrument of music is being used to make art and make music</span>
                <span class="text-line">A violin is supposed to be a small instrument</span>
                <span class="text-line">with 26 strings and a handle to play with</span>
                <span class="text-line">Note that the strings are at different pitches</span>
                <span class="text-line">You want to make sure that the strings don't poke into you</span>
                <span class="text-line">The handle can be a small object</span>
                <span class="text-line">and is usually a stick that holds hair together</span>

                <span class="text-line">In order to perform the violin</span>
                <span class="text-line">Usually one player is required</span>
                <span class="text-line">Maybe a different player would try and move some objects closer to the string</span>
                <span class="text-line">Sometimes the objects are moved into the violin without causing the strings to vibrate very much</span>
                <span class="text-line">This does not actually make much sense</span>

                <span class="text-line">Try playing the violin</span>
                <span id="action" class="text-line"></span>
                <span class="text-line">The violin sounds pretty weak, but you play it as if it is no different than you play it now</span>
                <span class="text-line">The violin is in fact more like a human in a violin than it is an instrument</span>
                <span class="text-line">They are both more complex and stronger than you are</span>
                <span class="text-line">Try again</span>
                <span id="action" class="text-line"></span>

                <span id="next-story" class="text-line">Play the next story &rarr;</span>
