                <span class="text-line">Metallic sound</span>
                <span class="text-line">You see a light coming (from the end)</span>
                <span class="text-line">This light contains an exhaust unit.</span>
                <span class="text-line">The exhaust unit consists of a single coil</span>
                <span class="text-line">Connected to a single core.</span>
                <span class="text-line">The exhaust sound comes from a light bulb</span>
                <span class="text-line">The light bulb's sound is a short (25 seconds) vibration</span>
                <span class="text-line">When in use it can be either a strong vibration (usually a lot of air, or a lot of light, sometimes a lot of heat).</span>
                <span class="text-line">Or very mild vibration (with a lot of piercing noise).</span>
                <span class="text-line">The sound also contains different colours of the light bulb,</span>
                <span class="text-line">Usually red (when the light is completely red)</span>
                <span class="text-line">And purple (when a small light bulb can be seen).</span>
                <span class="text-line">The sound also contains water and a strong vibration.</span>
