                <span class="text-line">I can hear a ticking sound coming closer to me</span>
                <span class="text-line">I can't really stop it in any sense of the word</span>
                <span class="text-line">I'm trying to control it</span>
                <span class="text-line">A ticking sound is a great way to break up your anxiety</span>
                <span class="text-line">and help you start focusing on your job</span>
                <span class="text-line">The sound could be anything from a distant, thunderous noise</span>
                <span class="text-line">to a deep, deep, deep beat</span>
                <span class="text-line">You can change it up</span>
                <span class="text-line">You can control it</span>
                <span class="text-line">You can adjust the timing of the sound to your needs</span>
                <span class="text-line">It takes 2â€“5 minutes to synchronise the timing of the sound (with the
                    lights)</span>
                <span class="text-line">Try it!</span>
                <span id="action" class="text-line"></span>
                <span class="text-line">I found it was easier to just go for it and try harder</span>
                <span class="text-line">If you make these changes you'll get a better audio experience as well as some
                    more inspiration</span>
