    <h1>Funk</h1>

    <div id="container">
        <div id="game">
            <p id="text">
                <span class="text-line">The instruments are played like a bass guitar and drums</span>
                <span class="text-line">The drums are played on drums by “Funk”</span>
                <span class="text-line">and then the sounds are played by “Muff” on the bass guitar</span>

                <span class="text-line">In general, this band is introspective and focused, with a lot of effort and
                    energy</span>
                <span class="text-line">There are also good riffs and melodies here that compliment the rhythmic
                    elements of the music</span>
                <span class="text-line">and some of these rhythms might be better suited to the listener than just being
                    repetitive</span>
                <span class="text-line">but not terribly different from what you'd hear from other bands</span>
                <span class="text-line">I find the rhythm more reminiscent of the heavier heavy, more contemporary rock
                    version of the theme</span>
                <span class="text-line">and more upbeat</span>

                <span class="text-line">The drums are played as a series of different notes divided in sets</span>
                <span class="text-line">including a set of two</span>
                <span class="text-line">a three level</span>
                <span class="text-line">two level</span>
                <span class="text-line">a three level</span>
                <span class="text-line">one level</span>
                <span class="text-line">one level</span>
                <span class="text-line">two level</span>
                <span class="text-line">four level</span>
                <span class="text-line">and one, one, one, one level</span>
