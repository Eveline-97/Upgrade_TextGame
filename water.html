                <span class="text-line">For starting, follow the instructions</span>
                <span class="text-line">And connect in the electric circle</span>
                <span class="text-line">The electric circle is connected to the ground by a piece of metal</span>
                <span class="text-line">When touched, it provides a very short resistance</span>

                <span class="text-line">What is the vibration of a sound?</span>

                <span class="text-line">Sound vibrations are a form of sound produced by the brain</span>
                <span class="text-line">and these vibrations act on or alter the physical or mental state of the person
                    performing they act of them</span>
                <span class="text-line">These vibrations are expressed through a series of vibrations which are recorded
                    in the brain of the person who produces them</span>
                <span class="text-line">thus acting as the sound system of the person performing them</span>

                <span class="text-line">We are talking to you about sound vibrations</span>
                <span class="text-line">To make a sound is to create it into an environment of sound which may be
                    heard</span>
                <span class="text-line">and heard in the world which you have created</span>
                <span class="text-line">You have created sound as a form of sound</span>
                <span class="text-line">Your physical or mental activity is the same as the vibrations which your mind
                    carries out</span>

                <span class="text-line">As a result of these vibrations, your brain and the brain of the person who
                    produces you sound the same</span>
                <span class="text-line">They sound like water with a strong vibration</span>

                <span class="text-line">Make the water vibrate</span>
